# Knickers
An almost naked Wordpress plugin.

Run a find and replace for 'knickers' - replace with your unique plugin function identifier, preferably starting with 'd4' to make sure that it is unique (used for handles, functions, etc). You will also want to rename the javascript files to match their registration urls below.
